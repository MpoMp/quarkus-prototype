# The Quarkus Prototype (until I think of a better name)

Practicing the art of Java development through Quarkus.

The `adr` directory contains all the architectural decision records. 

Details about setup and development can be found at [SETUP](SETUP.md). 

I'm in essence following the "Quarkus in Action" book. 
Once that's done, this repository will 
either become a happy little hobby project 
or be archived as a point of reference for future Quarkus work.
